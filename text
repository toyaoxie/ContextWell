My GitHub Pages site is hosted at /contextwell/.
Site structure uses directory-based routing with index.html in each folder.
Global header and footer are injected from /contextwell/partials/header.html and /contextwell/partials/footer.html.
Navigation paths must match these routes:
/contextwell/, /contextwell/about/, /contextwell/projects/, /contextwell/projects/doctoral-project/, /contextwell/solutions/, /contextwell/solutions/well-being-builder/, /contextwell/library/, /contextwell/for-organisations/.
Please update only the partials and keep links consistent with this routing.
