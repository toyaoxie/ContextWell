                The project explores and progressively defines well-being as a composite and sustainable human capacity. This capacity enables individuals to engage with, regulate, and harness tools and environments, including AI, across diverse life contexts such as study, relationships, family roles, institutional demands, and AI mediated settings.

                Well-being efficacy and human oversight are treated as two perspectives on the same underlying capacity requirement. They differ primarily in framing, human functioning versus governance and systems, while sharing a common functional core.

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Capacity under pressure across social microcosms</h2>
          <div class="space-y-3 text-slate-300 text-sm">
            <p>
              Individuals are not defined by a single role. They operate within multiple social microcosms, understood here as distinct but interacting social settings such as work, family, education, institutions, and technology mediated environments, which shape expectations, responsibilities, and decision making across everyday life.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a rapidly changing world, individuals are required to make decisions under uncertainty and time pressure, manage competing demands across work, relationships, family roles, and institutional settings, and increasingly interact with AI mediated tools that shape feedback, prioritisation, and pace.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many existing well-being approaches conceptualise well-being primarily as a psychological state or as an outcome measured after difficulty occurs. These approaches offer limited explanatory power for understanding how individuals function within complex situations as they unfold.
            </p>
            <p>
              ContextWell responds to a different need. It focuses on developing sustainable human capacity for operating well across changing social microcosms, with a focus on capacity development before depletion occurs.

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Well-being as a functional capacity</h2>
          <div class="space-y-3 text-slate-300 text-sm">
            <p>ContextWell positions well-being as a functional capacity rather than a transient emotional state.</p>
            <p>Instead of asking only whether an individual feels well, the project asks what capacities enable an individual to sustain judgment, emotional stability, and action across diverse and demanding contexts.</p>
            <p>This capacity is composite in nature. It consists of interacting capabilities that are activated and configured differently depending on the situation. The framework emphasises capacities such as situational awareness and sense making, differentiation between interpretations and constraints, emotional stability under pressure, relational navigation and boundary management, and action design within real world limits.</p>
            <p>These capacities interact dynamically. For example, situational awareness supports differentiation between options and constraints, which in turn stabilises emotional responses and enables more deliberate action design.</p>
            <p>A central premise of the project is transferability. The same underlying capacity structure should be reusable and adaptable across contexts, even when surface conditions change.</p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Human oversight and well-being efficacy</h2>
          <div class="space-y-3 text-slate-300 text-sm">
            <p>Shared capacity demands. A central clarification in ContextWell is that the underlying demands of well-being efficacy and human oversight are substantively aligned.</p>
            <p>Well-being efficacy refers to the internal functional capacity that allows individuals to remain clear, emotionally stable, and action capable within context. Human oversight refers to the situational expression of that same capacity, particularly in environments shaped by systems, institutions, or AI.</p>
            <p>The distinction between the two is analytical in nature and unified in substance. In practice, both depend on similar capabilities such as maintaining judgment under pressure, differentiating between system influence and personal responsibility, and sustaining agency in constrained environments.</p>
            <p>When this capacity is insufficient, individuals experience reduced agency, increased strain, and responsibility confusion. When it is sufficient, oversight remains operational and well-being is experienced as functional stability rather than comfort.</p>

        </section>

        <!-- AI -->
        <section id="ai" class="bg-slate-900 border border-slate-800 rounded-xl p-6">
          <p class="text-xs uppercase tracking-wide text-emerald-400 mb-2">The role of AI</p>
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">AI as context shaping force and replicable support</h2>
          <div class="space-y-3 text-slate-300 text-sm">
            <p>In ContextWell, AI is not treated simply as an external technology. It is conceptualised as a context shaping force and as a replicable tool for capacity training and extension.</p>
            <p>AI systems increasingly shape how individuals learn, decide, and act by accelerating information flow, producing recommendations with perceived authority, and altering boundaries of responsibility and accountability. These features can amplify capacity depletion if individuals lack the ability to engage with such tools appropriately.</p>
            <p>ContextWell explores how AI can be deliberately harnessed to support human judgment and learning in ways that strengthen and preserve human judgment. AI is positioned as a scalable support for repeated reflective practice and capacity development, not as a decision maker.</p>
            <p>From this perspective, well-being efficacy functions as a human meta capacity. It refers to the capacity that governs how individuals engage with tools and environments, including when to rely on them, when to question them, and when to disengage.</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-slate-300 text-sm mb-6">
            <p>A key motivation for the project is that insight alone does not translate into sustained ability.</p>
            <p>Individuals may accurately understand their challenges and still struggle to act well in the moment, particularly under time pressure, role conflict, or system driven demands. ContextWell therefore focuses on making capacities practisable, reusable, and accumulative, with an emphasis on long term capacity development.</p>
