        <p>
          ContextWell Lab is an independent, research-led initiative.
          Support sustains the lab’s ability to operate, explore, and translate ideas into shared public value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Support can take three complementary forms.

      <!-- Donate -->
      <section id="donate" class="section">
        <h2>Donate</h2>
        <p>
          Donations provide flexible support that sustains the core operations of ContextWell Lab.
          They enable the lab to remain independent and to prioritise long-term human capacity over short-term optimisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Donations may contribute to:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>maintaining and refining open conceptual frameworks</li>
          <li>developing and maintaining experimental prototypes</li>
          <li>producing openly accessible educational and research resources</li>
          <li>supporting exploratory work outside conventional funding cycles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This form of support is especially suited to individuals who value open inquiry, public-interest research, and the careful development of ideas.
        </p>

      <!-- Sponsor -->
      <section id="sponsor" class="section">
        <h2>Sponsor</h2>
        <p>
          Sponsorship is designed for organisations, foundations, or programmes seeking to support a defined area of work within ContextWell Lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike donations, sponsorship is typically directed toward a specific research question, project line, or development phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sponsorship may support:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>a defined research or conceptual programme</li>
          <li>pilot studies or prototype development</li>
          <li>evaluation, documentation, and dissemination activities</li>
          <li>capacity-building initiatives aligned with shared priorities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sponsorship arrangements are developed through dialogue and shaped by mutual goals, scope, and constraints.
        </p>
        <div class="mt-4">
          <a href="mailto:CONTACT_EMAIL@example.com" class="btn">

      <!-- Collaborate -->
      <section id="collaborate" class="section">
        <h2>Collaborate</h2>
        <p>
          Collaboration is a central mode of operation for ContextWell Lab.
          The lab works with individuals and organisations interested in advancing well-being, judgment, and human oversight in complex and AI mediated environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collaborations are research-informed, exploratory, and practice-oriented.
          They are designed to generate shared understanding, test ideas in real contexts, and translate insights into usable outputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typical collaboration formats include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>research partnerships and co-authored studies</li>
          <li>pilot projects in educational, health, or organisational settings</li>
          <li>conceptual design and framework development</li>
          <li>advisory work on well-being and human oversight</li>
          <li>translation of research insights into tools, protocols, or learning systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Collaborations may be project-based, time-limited, or exploratory, depending on mutual aims and constraints.
        </p>
